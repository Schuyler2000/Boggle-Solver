# Boggle-Solver
solves n x n boggle board

Here I developed an algorithm to efficiently find all valid words in a boggle board.
I used a trie tree to represent a dictionary of over 200,000 words.

Run the program with "quick_solver.py" which will create a boggle board of dim x dim. 
Once yoou press ENTER, the valid answers found in the dictionary will be printed.
